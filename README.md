# Jupyter Notebooks used to evaluate the underwater camera
This repository contains a collection of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) and corresponding measurement data used to evaluate the underwater camera, which is part of the [Underwater Camera Project](https://underwater-camera-project.github.io). The "graphs" folder contains the generated diagrams.

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a great place to execute them for free. Each notebook contains all required data to execute them and there is also some description.
